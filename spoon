1. Launcher.
Initialized by 
a. class path
b. code directory
It can be considered as an object representing the VM. Where class path is used to run the code in code directory.
From a launcher, we can get a manager managing the "Code Model", and it will provide context in which the AST model can be created and maintained.

2. CtAbstractInvocation
In package:spoon.reflect.code, it contains the meta-model part that models the executable code.(methods and constructors' bodies, field initializers)

CtAbstractInvocation represents abstract invocation of a CtExecutable. 

CtExecutable represents an executable element such as method, constructor, or an anonymous block.

CtAbstractInvocation.getArgument() is different from CtAbstractInvocation.getExecutable().getArgument()
a. Former returns arguments by name. Invocation is code.
b. Later returns arguments by Type(class). Executable is reference.

3. Spoon meta Model
a. Structural part: declarations of the program element.
b. Code Part. Exectutable Java Code in method bodies.
c. Reference part.

4. CtReference
reference to a CtExecutable. Can be CtMethod or a CtConstructor

5. CtVariableRead and CtFieldRead
They are both from code. CtVariableRead is subclass of CtVariableRead. They both inherent from CtExpression.
CtFiledRead.getVariable().getDeclaration(): the class where the Field is declared.
CtFiledRead.getVariable() returns the CtField Ref, which can be used to get the QualifiedName: package.subPackage#fieldName

6. CtFieldRef
getDeclaration return CtFieldRef
CtFieldRef.getDeclaringType will return the literal code of the class where the CtFiled is declared.
